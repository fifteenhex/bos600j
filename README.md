Firmware to replace the original on the bos600 600mW
5.8ghz video transmitter to make it legal to operate
on the ATV part of the 5.6ghz band in Japan with a
ham license by removing the ability to use channels
that aren't within the ATV part of the band.
You will need to get a guarantee for the transmitter
before you can actually operate it.
